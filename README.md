## Hypothesis
**Does the price of **barrel of oil** and/or the **position of the moon** influence sales** of erotic toys?

One would think that in adult toy store, the environment influences purchase decision making, being a product that is not a staple and that mood could be a driver of purchase.

The year 2022 has been a year marked by economic instability in which countries such as the UK and Spain, which were not used to it, have experienced inflation, and their citizens have lost purchasing power.

The price of **barrel of oil** has suffered daily rises. Has this influenced the decision to buy erotic toys?

Could the **position of the moon** have influenced the days that adults have decided to invest in their erotic life by buying toys?

## Conclusions

A correlation can be seen between barrel price rises and falls and turnover in the second half of the year.

The phases of the moon do not seem to influence sales, while if they do, the phase that has coincided most with the rise in turnover is the new moon.
