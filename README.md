# Social-analysis-of-penis-length-worldwide


- [@paulaalvarezsa](https://github.com/paulaalvarezsa)



This is a project that through a process of **ETL** by **scraping**, **API** and CSV data sources, along with visualization with Matplotlib and Tableau, relates different sociological variables with the **average penis length** per country.

The different cross data are: 

1. Relationship between country average penis length and per capita income.

2. Relationship between country average penis length and life expectancy.

3. Relationship between life expectancy and per capita income.

4. Difference between penis measurements between data extracted by self-measurement and individual self-reporting of the measurement and data extracted by institutional measurements.
